# Welcome to simonberinglarsen.github.io

This repo contains a few demos of this and that - all related to "web / javascript" somehow.

# ghostngoblins (Ghost'n'Goblins goes javascript)

This repo is a rewrite of the ghost'n'goblins music on the c64 into javascript - originally sid tune was created by Mark Cooksey in 6502 machinecode.
Hopefully this will give you some insights and inspiration from the good old days - and knowledge about how "they" create that special chip-tune music back then!
