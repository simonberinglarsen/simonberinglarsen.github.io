        <h1>Sudoku One - Privacy Policy</h1>
        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            Simon Bering Larsen operates the app "Sudoku App". Find contact information here:
            https://github.com/simonberinglarsen/SudokuOne/issues. I
            take your privacy seriously. To better protect your privacy, I provide this privacy policy notice explaining
            the
            way
            your personal information is collected and used.
        </p>
        <h2>Collection of Routine Information</h2>
        <p>
            This app track basic information about its visitors. This information includes, but is not limited to, IP
            addresses, browser details, timestamps and referring pages. None of this information can personally identify
            specific visitors to this app. The information is tracked for routine administration and maintenance
            purposes.
        </p>
        <h2>Advertisement and Other Third Parties</h2>
        <p>
            Advertising partners and other third parties may use cookies, scripts and/or web beacons to track visitor
            activities
            on this app to display advertisements and other useful information. Such tracking is done directly by the
            third
            parties through their servers and is subject to their privacy policies. This app has no access or control
            over
            these cookies, scripts and/or web beacons that may be used by third parties.

            I use admob for displaying banner ads.
        </p>
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
            The security of your personal information is important to me, but remember that no method of transmission
            over
            the
            Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While I strive to use commercially acceptable
            means
            to
            protect your personal information, I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
        </p>
        <h2>Changes To This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy is effective as of 2022-08-14 and will remain in effect except concerning any changes in
            its
            provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page. I reserve the
            right
            to update or change my Privacy Policy at any time and you should check this Privacy Policy periodically. If
            I
            make
            any material changes to this Privacy Policy, I will notify you either through the email address you have
            provided me
            or by placing a prominent notice on my app.
        </p>
